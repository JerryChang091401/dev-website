# ðŸš€ Introduction

Welcome to the Software Engineering Club (DEV), a student organization on The Ohio State University campus. We empower students with new skills through interactive workshops, expose them to diverse opportunities in the field of Software Engineering, and provide the resources to launch their groundbreaking projects.

As a new club founded this fall, we already host over 200 total members, with over 30 active members participating weekly. In the upcoming semester, we are expanding our impact by hosting workshops in K-12 schools to foster curiosity and open up a world of opportunities for younger students.
