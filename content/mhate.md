# ❌ichigan

To show our support to the Buckeyes in the game against ❌ichigan, we have developed a website script to cross all the M's on your website. Upon page load, it will recursively search through all the elements on your page and wrap any M's with a hate tag. This script will not affect any of your content or styling, and will only change the appearance of the M's on your page.
