        <h1>üöÄ Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Software Engineering Club (DEV), a student-ran organization on the Ohio State University campus. Our mission is to empower students with new skills through interactive workshops, expose them to diverse opportunities in the field of Software Engineering, and provide the resources they need to launch their groundbreaking projects.

          As a new club founded this fall, we already proudly host over 150 total members, with over 30 active members participating weekly.

        <h1>üíµ Why Do We Ask You for a Sponsorship?</h1> 
          <p>
            DEV officers are all volunteers and we do not charge any membership fees to ensure that our club is accessible to all students. Your sponsorship is crucial to help us foster an inclusive and welcoming community of passionate students. If you choose to donate, your contribution will go towards the following:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Computing Resources Program ($1500 / year):</strong> DEV has a commitement to help OSU students build and launch their software-based projects. To do this, we share free cloud credits, subdomains, and other computing resources with our members. This program is a significant expense for our club, but it's essential to our mission.</li>
              <li><strong>Marketing and Outreach ($300 / year):</strong> This includes flyers, merch, and recruiting events, enhances our club's visibility within the campus and helps recruit new members.</li>
              <li><strong>Club Operations ($200 / year):</strong> This includes food for club meetings and other miscellaneous expenses.</li>
            </ul>

                This club is welcoming everyone regardless of their experience, major,

                recieve mentorship if you are not.
